=================

#### 1. Introduction:

This is a simple HTML5 game for the common problem known as Tower of Hanoi. You can solve it by yourself or let the game do it by pressing "Teach me".

#### 2. Instructions:

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi):

> The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

> * Only one disk can be moved at a time.
> * Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
> * No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

###### UPDATE 1 (Jun 26, 2015):

I made this game a loong time ago when learning JQuery, so do not expect it to be perfect (:

The game currently has has a very silly bug: It makes use of setIntervals for animation instead of using requestAnimationFrame. Yeah, that's so newbie, but I'm too busy to fix this. Click [here](http://creativejs.com/resources/requestanimationframe/) if you wanna learn more about this issue.

###### UPDATE 2 (Dec 28, 2022):

I decided to keep the original implementation despite its flaws to serve as the first game I ever created :)
