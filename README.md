###### WARNING: 

I made this game a loong time ago when learning JQuery, so do not expect it to be perfect (:

The game currently has has a very silly bug: It makes use of setIntervals for animation instead of using requestAnimationFrame. Yeah, that's so newbie, but I'm too busy to fix this. Click [here](http://creativejs.com/resources/requestanimationframe/) if you wanna learn more about this issue.
